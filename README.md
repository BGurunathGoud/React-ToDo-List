# React - ToDo List
1. It is used to set the daily Tasks of our Choice.
2. I have used React to develop the frontend of the application and listed some of the Fetched data from API.

## Installation of code in VS Code.
1. User should download all the project files related to this application.
2. Install all the dependencies in VS code.
3. Go to terminal if all packages are installed successfully and API link is there or not.
4. Set the correct directory path of the application.
5. Run npm install, because it will download the node modules dependencies.
6. Run npm start, then the project starts to run on localhost port 3000.

## Functioning of the ToDo List application
1. User need to open the link of the project on web browser.
2. Then a TodoList application is displayed.
3. Here user can see list of todo tasks listed in task container.
4. User can Modify or Change Task data by clicking on Edit button.
5. User can Add Task by typing task data in input form and click on Add Data then the data is displayed in below listed task details.
6. User can also set the task to complete state by clicking on Checkbox.
7. User can also delete the task by clicking on delete button.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
